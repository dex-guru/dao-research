# Common Problems

- Timezone management
    
    *Random international people in all different timezones inherently makes coordinating things difficult, but we've got a decent structure so things are cohesive*
    
- Rewards
    
    C*onsistent contributors reward, as proposals/grants do not take care of that aspect of day-to-day operations properly. Some tools like coordinate are doing a good job to help but there is still a long way to go to getting a system where someone can feel a sense of job security working with DAOs and be able to take on responsibilities like home/car ownership and a family.*
    
- Voting mechanics
    
    *We need to push past the Coin based voting system in passing proposals and decision making Opportunities are still emerging in this field and we are just getting started.*
    
    *DAO governance is currently very shallow and has a long way to go. Decentralization and regulatory issues persist.*
    
- Coordination
    
    *Community work can be quite hard to coordinate. You're not certain what everyone is working on and you don't know who is actually going to finish their project/improvement. It is really easy to say I'm going to fix x or build x and some can build/fix it but then it can be a question of can they implement it. You need the knowledge, execution, and votes to be productive in community governance.*
    
    *Unorganized, and even though it is meant to be less hierarchical, at certain points, need of control and power is overcoming the underlined ideology of DAOs.*
    
    *We need a little more structure.*
    
- Onboarding process
    
    *The biggest pain point are people who want to help but need to be helped to be able to help :) So, for now only very assertive people find something to do.*
    
    *Lack of guidance
    Some people need more guidance than others (ie some members are less self-initiating than others). My role is to provide guidance to such members - it can be a challenge sometimes.*
