# Digital Juries

New system to make decisions around how content moderation rules are formed. 

*As concerns have grown regarding harmful content spread on social media, platform mechanisms for content moderation have become increasingly significant. However, many existing platform governance structures lack formal processes for democratic participation by users of the platform.*

*Drawing inspiration from constitutional jury trials in many legal systems, this paper proposes digital juries as a civics-oriented approach for adjudicating content moderation cases.* 

*Building on existing theoretical models of jury decision-making, we outline a 5-stage model characterizing the space of design considerations in a digital jury process.* 

*We implement two examples of jury designs involving blind-voting and deliberation. From users who participate in our jury implementations, we gather informed judgments of the democratic legitimacy of a jury process for content moderation.* 

*We find that digital juries are perceived as more procedurally just than existing common platform moderation practices, but also find disagreement over whether jury decisions should be enforced or used as recommendations.*

**RQ1: How do users perceive the democratic legitimacy of a content moderation process involving user juries vs. the status quo of no user input?**

Content analysis of the open ended responses supports the presence of a procedural justice
framework among participants, with most users discussing process over outcome when comparing conditions.

**RQ2: How do users perceive the democratic legitimacy of a jury process with consensus by voting vs. by deliberation?**

The differences between the two jury conditions was less pronounced, with only “care” being perceived as significantly greater in the IMMERSIVE (deliberating) condition over the
SCALEABLE (voting) condition.

**RQ3: Would users prefer jury decisions to be directly enforced or passed on to platforms as recommendation?**

We saw no statistical difference in preference for either enforcement or recommendation of jury decisions with both options at a mean of 3.34 and mode of 3 on the 5-point Likert scale
