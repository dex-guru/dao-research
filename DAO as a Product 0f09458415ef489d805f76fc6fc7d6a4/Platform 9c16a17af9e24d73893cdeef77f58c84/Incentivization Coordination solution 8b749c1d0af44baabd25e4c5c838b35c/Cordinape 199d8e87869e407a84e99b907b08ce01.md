# Cordinape

Coordinape is a platform for DAOs to easily and fairly distribute resources to contributors. Community grants, internal salaries, and special projects can all be incentivized and rewarded by the community itself. Instead of cumbersome voting or black box committees, contributors themselves can quickly and transparently reward the value they see being created.

Coordinape is a DO (decentralized operations) platform that aims to solve the other half: a structure to make operational decisions within a team of contributors. If a DAO is the decentralized version of a board of directors plus shareholders, a DO is the decentralized version of the executive team plus contributors themselves.

Coordinape is currently implemented off-chain while the team continue to develop an on-chain version, using an EVM compatible L2 or side-chain.

### Allocation process

- At the start of the epoch, each member of the Circle receives a number of non-divisible GIVE tokens (Determined by the Circle Admin)
- Members allocate their GIVE tokens to other members over the course of the epoch to reward them for the value they bring to the Circle
- Members can adjust their allocations up until the end of the epoch
- They can add notes to their allocations if they wish
- At the end of the epoch, all allocated GIVE tokens become locked (now called GET tokens), and all unallocated GIVE tokens are burned
- Budget distribution is then formulated according to the percentage of total GET tokens that each member of the circles has received
