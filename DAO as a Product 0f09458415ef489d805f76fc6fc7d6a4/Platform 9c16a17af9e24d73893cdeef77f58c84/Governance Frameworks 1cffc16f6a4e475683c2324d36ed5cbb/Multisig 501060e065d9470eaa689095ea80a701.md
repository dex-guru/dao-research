# Multisig

A multisig (also known as a multisignature wallet) is a smart contract that offers hightened security for funds or sensative admin controls. Control over the contract is split between several individual "signers" (other individuals with a linked wallet address), and "M of N" signers are required to approve any transactions from the multisig.

### **Protocols**

- Synthetix
- Yearn Finance
- Sushiswap

### **Key Facts**

- Usually paired with [off chain voting](https://wiki.withtally.com/docs/on-chain-vs-off-chain-voting)
- Signers may be elected by vote, or unelected team members

### **Governance Process:**

- Multisig governance is typically paired with a signal voting mechanism to maintain legitimacy. As an example, Yearn, Synthetix, and Sushiswap all use the Snapshot voting tool to let token holders make key decisions and delegate authority.
- After considering a proposal in the community's discussion venue, a signal vote will be held to assess support. While this typically involves voting with Snapshot, in some cases communities may use on chain signal voting (eg. early Yearn [ygov.finance voting tool](https://ygov.finance/vote)) or off chain voting which is weighted by user accounts instead of token holdings (eg. polls in Discourse forums or Discord).
- Regardless of voting system used (on or off chain, weighted by users or token holdings), the vote itself doesn't trigger execution of the proposal's effects. Instead, the vote serves as instructions for the multisig signers to execute the proposal using their admin priveledges.

### **Drawbacks:**

- Multisigs can act against the will of their community or voters. With tokens used merely for signalling but lacking any executive control, it's possible for multisigs to slowly diverge from their community's interest. If multisigs are comprised of core team members, there may also be conflict on compensation and profit sharing.
- Multisigs have a small number of identifiable signers, which makes them a clear target for government regulation, legal actions, or other attacks. Multisig signers' discretion in executing their authority could also cause liability issues. So a distributed set of token holders could potentially offer greater censorship resistance.
