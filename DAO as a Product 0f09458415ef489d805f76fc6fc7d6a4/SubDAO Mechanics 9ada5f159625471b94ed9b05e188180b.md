# SubDAO Mechanics

# General Approach

![Untitled](SubDAO%20Mechanics%209ada5f159625471b94ed9b05e188180b/Untitled.png)

*Name: Sub DAO, Working Group, Squad, Work stream*

### **Main purpose**

- Centralization of efforts in specific business area (Strategy, Business Development, Engineering, etc) or product development (each Sub DAO a dedicated product team that includes appropriate roles)
- Separation of relatively independent business areas / communities

### Establishing

- Usually proposed by a core team or created by a general proposal
- Sub DAO creation proposal should include Name, Purpose, KPI, OKR and main details (wallet etc)

### Governance

- Sub DAO may have or have not internal governance platform depends on sub DAO structure and size.

### Management

- Typically Sub DAO has a head and VP / deputy head.
- Head is responsible for:
    - Management
    - Strategy & Goal setting
    - Roadmap
    - Execution
    - Contributor hiring
    - DAO wide communication
    - Reporting
- Position of Sub DAO head is elected by a proposal and rotated on periodic base

### Regulation

Rules applied to Sub DAO / Working group may be general and domain-specific.

- General overarching rules are intended to counteract tendencies towards monocentricity; they include rules that provide institutional mechanisms for separation of powers, monitoring, conflict resolution, appeal, system entry and exit.
- Domain-specific rules are tailored to the needs of particular domains, such as private production or public service provision, and often supply the mechanisms needed for a particular domain to effectively self-organize

### **Funding**

- Grants on periodic base via a proposal
- Sub DAO may have its own wallet
- Sub DAO may have or have not its own token, depends on level of autonomy.
    - In case there is a dedicated token, the DAO may have a stake in Sub DAO tokens to be able to have impact on decisions.

# Examples Overview

## [DX DAO](DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/DXDao%20e8998cc068494ad5a0192cdddd34b08d.md)

- **General**
    
    DAO has a flat organizational structure. DXdao functions in teams of contributors that are referred to as squads. Contributors within each squad coordinate responsibilities amongst themselves to further the interests of the DXdao community and its products. 
    
    There are 7 Squads within DAO: 
    
    - Business Development
    - Ecosystem and Product Development
    - Governance
    - Marketing / Communications / Community
    - Mesa
    - Omen
    - Swapr
- I**nteraction rules**
    
    DXdao has five regular calls held weekly related to BizDev, Development, Governance, Community, Product Strategy.
    
- **Specialization**
    
    Each squad focuses on a specific product and / or area of business.
    
- **Tokenomics / Governance**
    
    Squads are the part of the single DAO, the same token are utilized.
    
- **Leadership / Area of responsibility**
    
    Each squad has a squad leader that is the point of contact for inter-squad coordination and new contributors. The squad leader takes on an organizational role in roadmapping strategy and tracking the progress of contributors within the squad. The intention is to have rotating squad leaders.
    

## [Index Coop](DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/Index%20Coop%201a12c89105474c038875d534479aed40.md)

- **General**
    
    Working groups are formed to solve specific problems, or take advantage of specific opportunities, in service of the entire Coop community.
    
- **Interaction scheme**
    
    WG leader(s) are committed to serving the entire Index Coop with the outcomes they are being paid to produce. 
    
    WG leaders must commit to ensuring continuity of their work at the end of their specific WG’s existence.
    
- **Specialization**
    
    Working groups are formed to solve specific problems, or take advantage of specific opportunities, in service of the entire Coop community.
    
- **Tokenomics / Governance**
    
    Working group funding is approved & funded directly by the Treasury Committee (TC) after an in-the-open process.
    
- **Leadership / Area of responsibility**
    
    WGs should have 1 directly responsible individual, and at most, 1 additional co-lead.
    
    Responsible for making important / irreversible decisions
    

### [New Order DAO](DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/New%20Order%20bfa21f5401aa466c8c4de625229ffd7c.md)

- **General**
    
    SubDAO are forms as a department within DAO responsible for a specific business domain. Each subDAO leader is a multisig key holder that give them authority to participate in whole DAO governance. 
    
    The approach allows for expert community members to hold the multisig keys, instead of centralizing control in the core team. At genesis, a 6/9 multisig would be present that is hosted by Gnosis SafeSnap. 
    
- **Interaction scheme**
    - When a proposal idea arises, for example a strong opinion about the direction of the treasury yield investing, the community member has a direct department to communicate with.
    - The member will contact the department of Portfolio Management instead of contacting the general Q/A chat or DAO forum. With this approach proposal generation and community engagement is more organized and efficient, streamlining decision making.
- **Specialization**
    
    SubDAOs are specialized in the specific domain:
    
    - Financials / Accounting
    - Developer
    - Marketing
    - R&D / Grants
    - Partnerships / Business Development
    - Portfolio Management
    - Venture Strategist
    - Operations
    - Yield Farming
    - Decision Support
- **Tokenomics / Governance**
    
    DAO promotes a chain-agnostic approach, allowing to community members to embrace conformity to a united ecosystem, realizing the potential of being agnostic to a single layer one chain.
    
    ![Untitled](SubDAO%20Mechanics%209ada5f159625471b94ed9b05e188180b/Untitled%201.png)
    
- **Leadership / Area of responsibility**
    
    The department leaders are community elected through a rigorous analysis of their contributions to the success of the department that they are running in.
    
    Each of the departments will have an elected leader who will be paid by the DAO. The salary and the employment terms will all be decided by the payroll department.
    
    Each Department/branch within New Order would house a DAO multisig signer.
    

### [Rarible](DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/Rarible%20023eadd48f9146358217ffb82da4a49a.md)

- **General**
    
    DAO is composed of Working Groups, specialized by area of expertise. These group are somewhat autonomous in their operations and in the way they receive funding from the Parent DAO. Each of these will play complimentary roles in our go-to-market approach.
    
    ![Untitled](SubDAO%20Mechanics%209ada5f159625471b94ed9b05e188180b/Untitled%202.png)
    
- **Interaction scheme**
    
    The flow of funds would move from the parent Rarible DAO, to the working groups, and those working groups would be responsible for hiring, reporting, accountability internal to their group.
    
- **Specialization**
    
    SubDAOs are specialized in the specific business domain:
    
    - Protocol Foundation
    - Accelerator
    - Builders
    - Marketing
    - Operations
    
    ![Untitled](SubDAO%20Mechanics%209ada5f159625471b94ed9b05e188180b/Untitled%203.png)
    
- **Tokenomics / Governance**
    
    Each WG has it’s Snapshot and its multisig
    
- **Leadership / Area of responsibility**
    
    It least for now the internal working group structure is flat. WG is responsible for dedicated business / product area.
    

### [YGG DAO](DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/YGG%20DAO%20695a7e1cd7994d549bc219eb47859759.md)

- **General**
    
    A subDAO is akin to a specialized, miniature economy that interacts with a larger, all-inclusive economy, which is the DAO itself. 
    
- **Interaction scheme**
    
    SubDAOs have their own rules and conditions but still contribute earnings to the DAO itself. They can also borrow NFTs and other assets from the YGG Treasury in order to increase their level of contributions from gameplay.
    
    YGG Treasury will own an undefined % of each subDAO that contains a set of NFT assets. 
    
    The community owning the rest of the % of the subDAO will be composed of players to put the assets to play
    
- **Specialization**
    
    Each YGG subDAO is customized to focus on the specific activities and assets of a particular game. For example, there will be a subDAO dedicated to players of *Axie Infinity*, a subDAO dedicated to players of *League of Kingdoms*, and so on
    
- **Tokenomics / Governance**
    
    Each Sub DAO is paired with a community lead along with its own wallet and sub DAO token
    
- **Leadership / Area of responsibility**
    
    SubDAO token holders can vote on governance issues specific to that SubDAO, allowing them to have a say in how it operates.
    

### [Grape Network](DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/Grape%20Network%2039465e0ecbce41d99fa4b0d3832f5739.md)

- **General**
    
    The Grape Sub-DAOs are individual working groups that handle distinct community operations
    
- **Interaction scheme**
    
    Every subDAO appoints a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5 members responsible for organizing and prioritizing the subDAO’s proposals to the DAO.
    
    In case of internal disputes, the subDAO or any member can address the DAO for arbitration, since each subDAO reports to the DAO and by that, the Grape Community.
    
- **Specialization**
    
    The Grape DAO will start with 6 sub-DAOs that reflect the needs of the community today
    
    - Community Management (Moderators, Organizers)
    - Development (Developer)
    - Research (Researchers)
    - Creative (Designer, Videographer)
    - Content (Community Creators)
    - Panda Crew (Grape China)
- **Tokenomics / Governance**
    
    Each subDAO is free to establish its own governance system depending on its respective needs**.**
    
    In case of internal disputes, the subDAO or any member can address the DAO for arbitration, since each subDAO reports to the DAO and by that, the Grape Community.
    
- **Leadership / Area of responsibility**
    
    Each sub-DAO has a leader. This is the person contributing the most time organizing and communicating tasks within the sub-DAO. The sub-DAO leaders are voted every month by the sub-DAO.
    
    S**ub-DAO leader responsibilities**
    
    - Coordinate work requests within their sub-DAO
    - Identify new talent
    - Handle sub-DAO votes and proposals
    - Present during weekly DAO update

### [Gitcoin DAO](DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/GitcoinDAO%206bdbdbf870514a6d8b52c032e1c85df4.md)

- **General**
    
    Workstreams are the way work is organized in the DAO. They are the part of the DAO, and created as a part of decentralization way of the DAO.
    
- **Interaction scheme**
    
    Workstream creates the proposal on quarterly basis to request funds and setup KPI for the period. Once approved workstream starts working on it.
    
    On quarterly basis workstream reports on results and achievements.
    
- **Specialization**
    
    There are 6 working groups:
    
    1. [Moonshot Collective 31](https://www.notion.so/ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f) is the DAO rapid prototyping workstream
    2. [Public Goods 16](https://www.notion.so/80a3202a3a244c65b3fda08c0f7c7d60) is focused on our mission of funding public goods.
    3. [Fraud Detection & Defense 5](https://www.notion.so/f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae) is in charge of preventing fraud on Gitcoin Grants.
    4. [Decentralize-gitcoin 8](https://www.notion.so/c3197f918bf640bc9809cd26d56c93f3) is the mechanism through which Gitcoin is progressively decentralizing.
    5. [Memes, Merch, & Marketing 17](https://www.notion.so/c1bd89fac8ab4569bf2a676df28025d8) is the DAO marketing division.
    6. [dCompass 8](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-integrate-dcompass-within-dgitcoin-to-build-dquests-dknowledge/8836) - building DAO native orientation tool.
- **Tokenomics / Governance**
    
    GTC is a governance token and has no economic rights imbued within it. As such, there is nothing much to write here at this time.
    
- **Leadership / Area of responsibility**
    
    Workstreams have their own budget, leadership structure, tools, and processes on a per-workstream basis. Anyone can propose a workstream by the [proposal process](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v2-updated/7860)
    
    Workstreams are free to invite contributors.
    

### [UMA Project](DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/SuperUMAn%20DAO%209b265f9604c44c1985d2f19c038fbedc.md)

- **General**
    
    Initial DAO has been split into two: SuperUMAn DAO and UMA DAO
    
- **Interaction scheme**
- **Specialization**
    
    The SuperUMAn DAO is organised into functions with 9 teams as documented below together with their areas of responsibility.

### [MakerDAO](DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/MakerDAO%20e5666aafbf8340bdbfaa59097d1821cc.md)

- **General**
    
    DAO consists of set of Core Units, dedicated to specific business areas. Each core unit has a Mandate, akin to a *question* that the Facilitator must answer with the available resources.
    
    Core unit has one or multiple budgets; each with its implementation and its breakdown.
    
- **Interaction scheme**
    
    Core Units are proposed by community members and voted on by Maker Governance. Each Core Unit may have a budget (MIP40). The Facilitators (MIP41) of a Core Unit may have additional permissions over the Maker Protocol or Governance Processes depending on their Core Unit’s nature.
    
    ![Untitled](SubDAO%20Mechanics%209ada5f159625471b94ed9b05e188180b/Untitled%204.png)
    
- **Specialization**
    
    Core Units are at the intersection of Domains (which denote skillsets and capabilities) and Objectives (which denote cross-domain long term workstreams.)
    
    List of Core Units:
    
    - Risk
    - Oracles
    - Real World Finance
    - Growth
    - Protocol Engineering
    - GovAlpha
    - Content Production
    - Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling
    - Governance Communications
    - DAI Foundation
    - Development & UX
    - StarkNet Engineering
    - Strategic Happiness
    - Collateral Engineering
    - Data Insights
    - Deco Fixed Rate
    - Immunefi Security
    - Sidestream Auction Services
- **Tokenomics / Governance**
    
    Facilitators have special privileges in the Maker Governance Framework due to their trusted status in the Community and the requirements of their role as Facilitator of a Core Unit.
    
    Facilitator governance powers for particular Core Units can be extended through MIPs. They may include technical access to smart contracts like multisigs or other privileges in the governance process.
    
- **Leadership / Area of responsibility**
    
    The Facilitator is the most trusted actor in the Community; interacts with Governance and the Contributors to organize activities to achieve the Objectives. It contains the name and information and the commitment (the how).
    
    Facilitators play a key role in the Maker ecosystem by acting as the link between Maker Governance and the Contributors. Facilitators are always attached to a Core Unit that defines their primary responsibility and their Budget and Governance Powers.
    
    The Core Unit Budget allows the facilitators to meet their responsibilities by hiring Contributors and purchasing services and products. Facilitators attached to a Core Unit administer the Budget for that Core Unit. How this is implemented in practice depends on the specific Budget Implementation.
    
    Facilitators have special privileges in the Maker Governance Framework due to their trusted status in the Community and the requirements of their role as Facilitator of a Core Unit.
    
    Contributors are the groups of people performing the tasks to maintain and grow the protocol can focus on their job while the Facilitator acts as a proxy and deals with the bureaucracy of interacting with Maker Governance.
    

### [SushiSwapDAO](DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/SushiSwapDAO%20e0264dbb5680478f8035f99ddb737fa0.md)

- **General**
    
    *There is a current proposal which is still under discussion.*
    
    A new hierarchical structure clearly delineate roles and responsibilities for the following lead individuals. These individuals will work together to oversee the transition to the outlined structure and oversee the development of the vision established through governance.
    
    The goal is to give the service collective as much autonomy and flexibility as possible to effectively develop community-owned defi products while ensuring that all Sushi stakeholders continue to be the checks and balances system via governance.
    
- **Interaction scheme**
    
    Leadership from the service collective will participate in Monthly AMA’s to update and hear from the Sushi community.
    
    Leadership from the service collective will develop a quarterly grant approved via governance proposal and approved by the community, to then allocate resources effectively to each product line.
    
- **Specialization**
    
    Product-specific teams, composed of contributors that work within these teams but that also report to both VPs and subsequently Heads of three major groups. 
    
    Every product team would consist of one or multiple contributors focused on product, designers, front-end, solidity, web3, marketing, & business development. 
    
    ![Untitled](SubDAO%20Mechanics%209ada5f159625471b94ed9b05e188180b/Untitled%205.png)
    
- **Tokenomics / Governance**
    
    Governance will continue to oversee the allocation of all Treasury assets. This includes overseeing all grants to the service collective as well as grants from the upcoming Sushi Rolls platform. 
    
- **Leadership / Area of responsibility**
    
    The leadership team will work together to develop and execute a roadmap.
    
    They have discretionary powers to allocate resources to the different product teams based on the roadmap and opportunity set. 
    
    They also have the power to onboard contributors as well as set KPI’s for each contributor to hit. All decisions will go through a vote between the Head of Strategy, Head of Engineering, and Head of Operations and Business Development.
    
    Aggregate leadership (Heads and Vice Heads) of the service collective will be reviewed annually by governance. Additionally, a vote to renew the service collective will occur annually with the first votes for both taking place in June 2022.
