# Radical Transparency

## # What is Radical Transparency?

Radical transparency, the idea of everyone knowing everything

- **Radical truth** – The prioritization and focus on the utter truth at all times.
- **Radical transparency** – Answers can only reach the truth if they have all the information and data available to the person searching for the answer.
- **Getting in sync** – Creating shared truths that teams can operate around to maximize the effectiveness of these truth-realizations in a practical sense.

### **Advantages of radical transparency:**

- You understand what people are actually doing. This can be seen as a positive or a negative depending on who you are. As an employer, having access to your employee’s activities during their working day is likely a good thing. However, as an employee, this could be stressful.
- Problems are public. Although this is an advantage, it could have a negative impact on how your customers interact with your company.
- Goals are public. While this is good as it ensures all of your team knows what you are working toward, at all times. Having public goals means that you are also showing your competitors your game plan.
- Competitive threats are known. This has the same issue as the previous point.
- The company’s finances are public. Although advantageous for accomplishing “Radical Truth” (Ray Dalio’s concept) this point could cause problems within the team. As a woman, I think this level of transparency is a great thing and will help pressure companies to bridge the gender pay gap. But … I also see how it could cause conflict amongst teams where inequality or preference is evident.

### **Disadvantages of radical transparency:**

- Not being ready. Forcing radical transparency without [proper processes](https://www.process.st/business-process-management-software/process-improvement) in place to deal with the level of access customers will have to your company could be risky. This relates back to the “problems are public” point in the advantages.
- Not everyone likes it. In order for radical transparency to work the whole team needs to be on board. So, if an employee doesn’t feel comfortable with the heightened level of transparency – the entire company culture of transparency would be flawed.
- Performance anxiety. This relates to the “understanding what people are doing” point above. For employees, knowing that their progress is constantly being monitored … and judged could cause anxiety. This in turn could cause them to overwork or feel overwhelmed and withdraw themselves.
- Getting bogged down. The constant scrutiny and pressure to show up in all areas of working life could cause employees to feel bogged down.

## **Five dysfunctions**

Our values help us to prevent the [five dysfunctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team#Summary):

1. **Absence of trust** Unwilling to be vulnerable within the group => *prevented by collaboration, specifically* [kindness](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#kindness)
2. **Fear of conflict** Seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate => *prevented by transparency, specifically* [directness](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#directness) *and collaboration, specifically* [short toes](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#short-toes)
3. **Lack of commitment** Feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization => *prevented by transparency, specifically* [directness](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#directness)
4. **Avoidance of accountability** Ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards => *prevented by results, iteration, and* [transparency](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency)
5. **Inattention to results** Focusing on personal success, status, and ego before team success => *prevented by* [results](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#results)
