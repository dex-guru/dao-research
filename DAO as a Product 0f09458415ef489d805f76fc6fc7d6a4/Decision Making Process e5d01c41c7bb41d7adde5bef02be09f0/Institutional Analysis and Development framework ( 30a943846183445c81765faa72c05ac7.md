# Institutional Analysis and Development framework (IAD) - Ostrom

## 8 Principles

### **1. Commons need to have clearly defined boundaries.**

Without defining community boundaries, the use of a shared resource becomes a free-for-all, leading to overuse and collapse due to the [free-rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem).

**For example, participants could opt in to the boundaries of a Commons and receive tokens by contributing funds** (likely a stablecoin) to the ABC, **or contributing time** by proposing and completing tasks.

### **2. Rules need to fit local circumstances.**

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to shared resource management. Rules and values should be determined according to the needs of engaged participants and ecological limits, or they risk falling out of touch with people on the ground and become irrelevant. Commons architectures must enable value-aligned groups (including a [trusted core community](https://medium.com/commonsstack/the-trusted-seed-of-the-commons-stack-13d7e37f2de)) to coordinate around shared problems that are relevant to them.

**For example, in addition to deciding what funding streams are appropriate for its specific context** (such as whether to implement an ABC or an alternative funding tool), **a community can also choose an appropriate governance template**

### **3. Participatory decision-making is vital.**

Ostrom tells us that people will be more likely to follow the rules if they have a hand in writing and modifying them, and that including stakeholders in the decision-making process is the best way to ensure broad community buy-in.

**For example**, **whether participants contribute time or money, their skin-in-the-game will be rewarded with tokens from that community**

### **4. Commons must receive legal recognition in the jurisdictions where they operate.**

If rules agreed upon by a community are not recognized as legitimate within the community’s jurisdiction(s), friction is inevitable. Without legal recognition, a Commons risks falling apart either through the exploitation of its resources by outside groups, or due to an inability to escalate problems to higher-level authorities when internal sanctions are insufficient to settle a particular conflict.

### **5. Rules are enforced by effective & accountable monitoring.**

Once rules have been established, communities need a way of checking that people are following them, in a manner that is still accountable to those in the community. Contributors need good information to ensure they are making the best decisions for the future of the organization.

**For example, a member who submits a proposal** to carry out work in the community **is paid out for their efforts on verified milestone completion**,

### **6. Sanctions for violations should be graduated.**

The outright banning of people who break the rules tends to create resentment rather than strengthen a community. Instead, graduated systems of warnings, fines, and reputational consequences are less disruptive to an organization, and keep the punishments for wrongdoings proportional to the level of the offense.

**For example, a community may implement a reputation system that penalizes wrongdoing with a loss in social credibility, while others may go for metrics based on experience**

### **7. Conflict resolution should be easily accessible and low-cost.**

In other words, the process for overcoming issues that arise unexpectedly should be cheap and straightforward. Everyone should have the opportunity to seek mediation anytime a problem arises; no issue should be ignored due to the high costs associated with addressing it.

**For example, a low-level dispute could be resolved with a random court of 5 ‘jurors’ chosen from among the community who are incentivized to provide a judicious ruling**

### **8. Commons should be in nested ecosystems within larger commons.**

Some resources can be managed internally, while others call for wider regional cooperation, with nested layers of decision-making expanding jurisdiction to appropriate levels. For example, the management of a field may only require local stakeholders, whereas the management of a river should involve downstream stakeholders as well. Decision-making power should flow to the people most connected to that which is being governed.

**For example, local Commons could participate in regional Commons, which could collaborate with global Commons on work that helps to realize shared objectives.**

*In other words*

## 1 Clearly Defined Boundaries

**Individuals who have rights to appropriate resources must be clearly defined, as must the boundaries of the resource itself.**

## 2 Appropriate Rules

**Rules are appropriately related to local conditions (including both regarding the appropriation of common resources — restricting time, place, technology, quantity, etc; and rules related to provision of resources — requiring labor, materials, money, ets.)**

## 3 Rule-making processes

**Collective-choice arrangements allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process.**

## 4 Monitoring

**Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators.**

## 5 Sanctions

**There is a scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules.**

## 6 Conflict resolution

**Mechanisms of conflict resolution are cheap and of easy access.**

## 7 Self-governance

**The rights of a community to devise and govern its own institutions is recognized by external authorities.**

## 8 Nestedness/Subsidiarity/Polycentricity

**Appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises.**
