# Core Team Mechanics

### Gearbox Protocol

[https://www.notion.so/Gearbox-Protocol-70ca73f01f4640a8a47c2f47da5807b3](../DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/Gearbox%20Protocol%2070ca73f01f4640a8a47c2f47da5807b3.md)

Decentralization process along with community development. DAO limits the voting power, core team and whale

- Reverse escrow voting
- Community members including Credit Account Mining and other portions: full x1 multiplier.
- Contributors A meaning initial core members: multiplier of x0.125
- Contributors B meaning initial contributors: multiplier of x0.25
- Company wallet: cannot vote on anything before and if the governance model changes.
- DAO wallet: cannot vote unless it gives grants to people, which then gets x1 multiplier.
- C**ommunity voices are over x2 bigger in its voting power than early contributors and initial core members combined**!

### MeebitsDAO

- Initial Founding team that got converted into voting members + some other token holders. These members will vote on proposals, project plans, changes to the roadmap, awarding hackathon winners, etc.
- Non-voting members - token holders that can stake/delegate their tokens to voting members
- Voting rights is tokenized and transferrable after they have been fully distributed

## MakerDAO

[https://www.notion.so/MakerDAO-e5666aafbf8340bdbfaa59097d1821cc](../DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/MakerDAO%20e5666aafbf8340bdbfaa59097d1821cc.md)

Core teams are part of DAO operations. There are a list of core teams with approved mandates, budgets and the facilitator, who is also responsible for communication with governance. Initially DAO was governed by Foundation but then turned to community. 

*Foundation - The independent and self-governing Dai Foundation was formed to house the Maker community's key intangible assets, such as trademarks and code copyrights, and it operates solely on the basis of objective and rigid statutes that define its mandate. Its purpose, as noted in the Dai Foundation Trust Deed is to safeguard what cannot be technologically decentralized in the Maker Protocol.*

## BAO Finance

[Governance Mandates - Bao Finance](https://docs.bao.finance/governance-mandates)

For the system of governance the community elects a team to manage the Bao ecosystem.

**That team is pre-approved to spend up to 50% of the treasuries annual gain without any additional approval.** The team shall create any official votes using Snapshot.

The team must create votes when:

- They wish to spend >50% of the treasury within this year.
- They wish to spend >2.5% of a treasury fund in a single payment transaction.
- They wish to spend any money from the community fund.
- If they wish to change the cap of the Bao token, or the distribution rates.
- If they wish to change the rewards of different pools, or to add and remove new pools.
- In order to activate new features.
- To change the rules of governance, or approval percent.

The team does not need to create votes on other matters.

The community may create votes on any matter and they will be considered binding so long as the quorums are met.

## GitcoinDAO

[https://www.notion.so/GitcoinDAO-6bdbdbf870514a6d8b52c032e1c85df4](../DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/GitcoinDAO%206bdbdbf870514a6d8b52c032e1c85df4.md)

The version of Gitcoin that was developed between 2017 - 2020 1 is open source, but Gitcoin Holdings runs the website itself.

Core team - Gitcoin Product Group. They hope to become more integrated with the DAO and to itself begin working more as a workstream.

GTC is a fork of COMP, and allows delegation of voting power from everyday members of the DAO to a group of Stewards 1 - basically highly involved and active members of the DAO who’ve agreed to be involved in governance.

## Finance.vote

[https://www.notion.so/Finance-vote-36bf77f07f694a358771c6c2e973a608](../DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/Finance%20vote%2036bf77f07f694a358771c6c2e973a608.md)

The finance.vote team will take the project from concept to realised decentralised DeFi
ecosystem. They will realise the three core cryptoeconomic components outlined in this
whitepaper and facilitate the handover of the network to the community. They anticipate that
this process will take anywhere **from 18 months to three years**

The goal for any decentralised system, should be to make the initial founders irrelevant
and that is why we consider ourselves the “launch” team. The future team will be the token
holders. They will be the agents of the future of this network and their token holdings will
represent their power in the system.

The path to this “Exit to Community” is a multi-phase process that will require the establishment of norms and practices for working with both novel decentralised tools and new methodologies for decentralised governance.
The team takes on the responsibility for not only building the technology, but also leading
and educating the community to run the system sustainably for themselves.

The team will scale to a massively distributed group of decentralised individuals, that will
coordinate on a shared vision that begins with the narrative in the whitepaper, but will end
with an indeterminate goal.

### UMA DAO

Initially UMA DAO was a single DAO, with multiple member tier (SuperUMAns and UMAns).

SuperUMAns is minority of most engaged contributors of the DAO, while others are token holders and more passive members having voting rights.

In Jan 2022, DAO has been divided into 2 The SuperUMAn DAO and The UMA DAO.

- SuperUMAns
    - The SuperUMAns began as an earned role in the UMA Discord in Q1 of 2021. As the year progressed, Risk Labs gave a series of [KPI Option tokens](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4) to the community, aiming to help increase protocol adoption and community cohesion.
    - As the community got stronger, it became apparent that organizing and incentivizing them in a centralized way would be difficult to scale.
    - The Super Umans can move quickly on small grants + promotional programs. This allows them to operate independently of the team and the wider $UMA tokenholders.
    - As a result, Risk Labs [offered the SuperUMAns $1,000,000 worth of $UMA](https://discourse.umaproject.org/t/announcement-superuman-dao/1375) tokens to seed a DAO.
- UMA DAO
    - In addition to voting on requests to the optimistic oracle, UMA tokenholders will now vote on strategic funding decisions.
- There is 3rd organization which can be treated as a core team: Risk Labs
    - Risk Labs: Not a DAO — a foundation with over $50M of runway capital
    - Risk Labs operates within a mandate to support the UMA ecosystem. RL has diversified its holdings and has over $50M in non-$UMA token assets to provide years of development runway.
    - This foundation has a mandate to increase the adoption of the UMA protocol.
    - The foundation will retain a relatively small number of $UMA tokens in order to rapidly test incentive programs, but would need to bring them to a vote to fund those experiments for the long term.

### SushiSwapDAO

[https://www.notion.so/SushiSwapDAO-e0264dbb5680478f8035f99ddb737fa0](../DAOs%20a6ed52a31bd04b45ab62881d910e2c73/SushiSwapDAO%20e0264dbb5680478f8035f99ddb737fa0.md)

Sushi has operated with a flat organizational structure driven by specific cults of personalities. However, DAOs and digital asset protocols are still very nascent and require structure to continue to grow.

Hierarchical structure involve following postions:

- Heads of Strategy, Ops & BD, Engineering and Finance
- VP of Strategy, Ops & BD and Engineering
- Community Management
- HR
- Product teams, which includes roles: Solidity, Frontend, Business Dev, PM, Design and Marketing

The clear mandate of what decisions have to go through a governance vote, versus what decisions are left to the service collective should be established

Treasury multisig will remain subject to governance. 

![Untitled](Core%20Team%20Mechanics%203e647fe7cff04e2f8aae2b3f4cc1720e/Untitled.png)

The leadership team will work together to develop and execute a roadmap.

They have discretionary powers to allocate resources to the different product teams based on the roadmap and opportunity set. 

They also have the power to onboard contributors as well as set KPI’s for each contributor to hit. All decisions will go through a vote between the Head of Strategy, Head of Engineering, and Head of Operations and Business Development. 

This will ensure that all aspects of Sushi and its products are represented in the decision-making process as well as prevent one team lead from taking too much power. 

Leadership from the service collective will develop a quarterly grant approved via governance proposal and approved by the community, to then allocate resources effectively to each product line.
