# GitcoinDAO

GitcoinDAO is a community of internet citizens who builds & funds digital public goods, like Open Source Software.

### Governance

GTC is a governance token with no economic value.

- Token holders delegate their votes to a trusted steward. Some choose to self delegate.
- The stewards then accept or decline actions by voting for proposals which pass quorum.
- Official proposals and formal conversations on governance can be found on the Governance Forum

The¬†[GTC.sol](https://github.com/gitcoinco/governance/blob/main/contracts/GTA.sol)¬†contract is an ERC20 contract forked from Uniswap/Compound. Beyond the standard ERC20 functionally it also has a token delegation feature that allows token holders to allocate voting shares to other addresses or delegates. More detailed info on the contract can be found¬†[here](https://github.com/gitcoinco/governance-docs/blob/main/GTC-TOKEN.md).

GitcoinDAO uses GovernorAlpha / Timelock / TreasuryVester

GTC is a fork of COMP, and allows delegation of voting power from everyday members of the DAO to a group of¬†[Stewards¬†1](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41/28)¬†- basically highly involved and active members of the DAO who‚Äôve agreed to be involved in governance. This is whats commonly called¬†[Liquid Democracy¬†4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy).¬†

## Core team

The¬†[version of Gitcoin that was developed between 2017 - 2020¬†1](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web)¬†is open source, but Gitcoin Holdings runs the website itself

Over the past 2-3 months, since the DAO launched, we have seen the emergence of a new group of leaders in the DAO ecosystem. These leaders have been granted the governance rights of the network, laying the¬†[ethical foundation¬†5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed)¬†for a group of decision makers to make decisions with high legitimacy about how to action initiatives that support our shared mission.

### Quadratic Funding

Quadratic Funding (QF) is a more democratic and scalable form of matching funding for public goods, i.e. any projects valuable to large groups of people and accessible to the general public.

‚ÄúMatching funding‚Äù is a model of funding public goods where a fund from governments or philanthropic institutions matches individual contributions to a project. QF optimizes matching funds by prioritizing projects based on the number of people who contributed. This way, funds meant to benefit the public go towards projects that¬†*really benefit a broad public*, instead of things that only have a few wealthy backers. In QF, [total funding] for a proposal is [the square root of each contribution to it ‚Üí summed up, then squared.] QF strongly encourages people to make contributions, no matter how small, and ensures a democratic allocation of funds meant to benefit the public.

### Working Groups

Workstreams are the way work is organized in the DAO. Workstreams have their own budget, leadership structure, tools, and processes on a per-workstream basis. Anyone can propose a workstream by following the¬†[proposal process](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v2-updated/7860)

1. [Moonshot Collective¬†31](https://www.notion.so/ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)¬†is the DAO rapid prototyping workstream
2. [Public Goods¬†16](https://www.notion.so/80a3202a3a244c65b3fda08c0f7c7d60)¬†is focused on our mission of funding public goods.
3. [Fraud Detection & Defense¬†5](https://www.notion.so/f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae)¬†is in charge of preventing fraud on Gitcoin Grants.
4. [Decentralize-gitcoin¬†8](https://www.notion.so/c3197f918bf640bc9809cd26d56c93f3)¬†is the mechanism through which Gitcoin is progressively decentralizing.
5. [Memes, Merch, & Marketing¬†17](https://www.notion.so/c1bd89fac8ab4569bf2a676df28025d8)¬†is the DAO marketing division.
6. [dCompass¬†8](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-integrate-dcompass-within-dgitcoin-to-build-dquests-dknowledge/8836)¬†- building DAO native orientation tool.

## Operation

### DAO‚Äôs Quarterly Cadence

Gitcoin operates in a quarterly cadence.¬†[Quarterly Gitcoin Grants Rounds are our Metronome¬†2](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-is-our-metronome/9310)

Every quarter, the Gitcoin ecosystem revolves around a quarterly stacked event -¬†*a combination (1) Gitcoin Grants round, (2) Hackathon, (3) KERNEL block, and (4) Governance activity*

During each quarter, we achieve our mission by deploying millions of $$$ of funding to the community. Typically a quarter looks like this:

1. Plan for quarterly stacked event.
2. Execute quarterly stacked event.
3. Learn from the quarterly stacked event.
4. Repeat
