# Radicle

Radicle is a decentralized code collaboration network built on open protocols. It enables developers to collaborate on code without relying on trusted intermediaries. 

### Governor

- Compound Governance

### Governance

Radicle’s governance process is structured around an expectation of self-direction. Community “champions” (the individual(s) who created a proposal) are expected to escalate proposals from phase to phase, with guidance from community moderators.

Temperature Check → Structured Discussion → Formal Review → Governance Proposal

Create a Temperature Check to initiate an informal discussion around a proposed idea and/or change.

Use feedback from the Temperature Check to draft a proposal that meets the criteria set in this document and start a Structured Discussion (t/r 5 days)

Submit the draft proposal for Formal Review by creating a Snapshot poll 10 (t/r 5 days)
If passed, deploy a Governance Proposal via rad gov 38. (t/r 3 days)
