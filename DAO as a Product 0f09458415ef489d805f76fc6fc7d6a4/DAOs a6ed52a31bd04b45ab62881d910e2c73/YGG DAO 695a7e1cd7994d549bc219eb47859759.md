# YGG DAO

Yield Guild Games (YGG) is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for investing in non fungible tokens (NFTs) used in virtual worlds and blockchain-based games

Activities of YGG include:

- Building a global community of play-to-earn gamers who play competitively to collect
in-game rewards (e.g. players in Axie Infinity earning tokens from winning battles);
- Producing revenue through the rental or sale of YGG-owned NFT assets for a markup
(e.g the resale of land in The Sandbox or renting Axies to players as part of a
profit-sharing model, known as a scholarship);
- Allowing the community to participate in the DAO by passing proposals and voting;
- Coordinating research and development for gamers in the DAO to arbitrage on yield
generation by being competitive in metaverse-related games.

### Governance

Governance issues to be voted upon by YGG DAO members will revolve around:

- Technology implementations
- Products and projects
- Token distribution
- Governance structure

Any guild member part of the YGG network can send proposals through the YGG website, for the ecosystem to cast their votes.

The YGG DAO will consist of five main categories of token holders:

- Founders
- Advisors
- Treasury
- Investors
- Community (Up to 45% of all YGG tokens have been designated for distribution among community members through a variety of means)

Ways to earn YGG tokens include:

- Airdrops
- Bonus rewards for game winners
- Level-up and loyalty rewards
- Rewards for contributions to DAO management
- Staking rewards

### Sub DAO

- A subDAO is akin to a specialized, miniature economy that interacts with a larger, all-inclusive economy, which is the DAO itself.
- Each YGG subDAO is customized to focus on the specific activities and assets of a particular game. For example, there will be a subDAO dedicated to players of *Axie Infinity*, a subDAO dedicated to players of *League of Kingdoms*, and so on
- SubDAOs have their own rules and conditions but still contribute earnings to the DAO itself. They can also borrow NFTs and other assets from the YGG Treasury in order to increase their level of contributions from gameplay.

Each game is paired with:

- a community lead who is passionate about that game
- its own wallet
- SubDAO token

SubDAO token holders can vote on governance issues specific to that subDAO, allowing them to have a say in how it operates

YGG Treasury will own an undefined % of each subDAO that contains a set of NFT assets. The community owning the rest of the % of the subDAO will be composed of players to put the assets to play

- Example
    
    For example, members of the same subDAO can plan quests or raids on other guilds, decide on purchases of land or in-game items, and be rewarded with badges for ranking up to new levels within the guild. SubDAO members will be rewarded according to their level and efforts, and will be able to earn specific NFT achievements for their contributions.
    
    YGG is therefore a DAO composed of subDAOs, each contributing in its own way. SubDAOs will allow the guild to operate more efficiently by localizing its operations and streamlining processes that might vary from game-to-game. By encouraging players of the same game to work with one another, SubDAOs also serve to create a more localized sense of community within the much broader YGG community.
    
    An example of a subDAO can be found in the YGGLOK token. After Yield Guild purchased significant assets within the *League of Kingdoms* game, they tokenized this collection of assets by creating the YGGLOK token. Holders of this token not only receive access to the yields generated by the tokenized assets but can also vote on subDAO specific issues. Giving subDAO participants a say in these issues will help optimize their productivity during gameplay, thus allowing them to earn more rewards for the guild and themselves as well.
