### Contributors Onboarding Process

[COPPER OWL QUEST (New Joiners) - Index Coop Community Handbook](https://docs.indexcoop.com/new-joiners)

### Contribution categories

Contribution types and desired outcomes are generally separated into the following categories:

- **Strategy** - Has this member’s contributions improved our understanding of key product, marketing, business development, strategy, or product development issues?
- **Marketing** - How much awareness did this contributor bring to Index Coop & its major target narratives?
- **Product Development** - What were the outcomes of the product development work of this contributor? What was the size of the contribution?
- **Business Development** - What increased distribution, increased legitimacy, or increased TVL did this contributor’s BD efforts contribute to?
- **Community & Organization** - How have these contributions clarified, and bolstered culture & process within the Index Coop community?

### Working Groups Process

Working groups are formed to solve specific problems, or take advantage of specific opportunities, in service of the entire Coop community.

1. **Concrete Outcomes/Measurable Results**: Ahead of their creation, it is clear what they intend to accomplish for the Coop. They are responsible for producing outcomes that impact Index Coop objectives.
2. **Big Commitment**: WG leader(s) are committed to serving the entire Index Coop with the outcomes they are being paid to produce. This is for the comparatively few folks who have the time, energy, bandwidth, focus, and desire to uphold this level of commitment. WGs should have 1 directly responsible individual, and at most, 1 additional co-lead.
3. **Time-bound**: For starters, they are time-bound to a given quarter at most. We need to maximize iteration & learning.
4. **Funding**: They are approved & funded directly by the Treasury Committee (TC) after an in-the-open process.
5. **Reporting**: Leaders will be required to set KPIs and update the Coop each week on their progress. Growing the pool of shared understanding is a fundamental goal.
6. **Continuity Commitment**: WG leaders must commit to ensuring continuity of their work at the end of their specific WG’s existence.
7. **No overlap**: WG’s should not be redundant with an already operating WG.

## Decision Making Process

RAPID is a decision-making framework popularized by Bain. The goal of this process is to enable our team to make decisions in a manner that ensures that all relevant information and perspectives are accounted for, maximizes buy-in for decisions and creates a record of the process that can be referred to in future.

****1. Create Initial Proposal****

- Person who wants to raise an issue or proposed solution should write it up clearly in advance of group meeting to give others the opportunity to review.
- During the meeting, each proposal should be discussed for no more than 5 minutes. **If a clear consensus solution is found or the appropriate decision-maker has enough information/feedback to make a decision, document next steps and move forward.**
- If there is no clear consensus after 5 minutes, the proposer should schedule a separate decision meeting to review and follow the RAPID process.

**2. Determine Who Should Make Final Decision**

- Type 1 (High Impact, Irreversible): Index Coop Leadership (Working Group Leads). When there are disagreements on type 1 vs 2, assume decision is type 1.
- Type 2 (Lower Impact/Reversible): Person proposing the decision/issue should recommend who they believe is the most appropriate person to make the final decision.

****3. Decision-Making Process****

Write up decision/recommendation using the template for RAPID decision-making & distribute to the group for written feedback.

Once everyone has provided their feedback, schedule a meeting to discuss and make a decision.

****4. Tracking/Documentation****

Once completed, the decision document should be archived in notion. These can be referenced later for post mortem analysis, training purposes and accountability.

****Seeking Consensus vs. Being Decisive****

- Goal is to make thoughtful, values-aligned decisions quickly and take action. Consensus is nice-to-have but can lead to lost time.
- When proposing a solution to the group, if there is immediate (<5 mins of discussion) consensus, assign a DRI to execute and move forward.
- If no consensus is immediately reached, implement RAPID as described in this doc.
- The goal of RAPID is to ensure that the person making a decision has all of the input from team members that they need, not to build a consensus between these people.
- Once a decision has been made, follow a "disagree and commit" philosophy. Any contentious proposals can be settled via $INDEX governance.
