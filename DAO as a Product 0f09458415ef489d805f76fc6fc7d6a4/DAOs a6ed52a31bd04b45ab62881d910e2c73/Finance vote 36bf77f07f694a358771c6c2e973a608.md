# Finance.vote

### Governance

The finance.vote governance architecture is intended to introduce a new paradigm of governance into the cryptospace, utilising both **a layer one DAO**, the **Decentralized Monetary Fund (DMF)** and the **Layer two $FVT miniDAO** in a bicameral governance structure.

**Decentralized Monetary Fund (DMF)**

The DMF sets the inflation rate by creating new reward pools and initiating new voting markets. It also controls the ecosystem development fund, which will add full transparency to the assets designed to maximise the impact of finance.vote ecosystem within the crypto community.

**The $FVT MiniDAO**

The $FVT MiniDAO will showcase the potential of second layer governance by developing the finance.vote ecosystem in partnership with the users. A series of feature votes will be launched, early in the Pyramid phase, which will allow users to vote on future tournaments and reward pool sizing. The $FVT MiniDAO is where policy is debated prior to ratification and material shifts in direction of the system occur.

The second layer governance system is built to convert rough consensus and dialogue into
actionable decisions in both the layer one DAOs of the finance.vote. 

With the integration of semantic ballot voting, miniDAOs are dialogic spaces driven by
cryptoeconomics. Users will be able to create their own votes, vote on discussion topics
and curate ideas and sources.

## Core team

The finance.vote team will take the project from concept to realised decentralised DeFi
ecosystem. They will realise the three core cryptoeconomic components outlined in this
whitepaper and facilitate the handover of the network to the community. We anticipate that
this process will take anywhere **from 18 months to three years**

The goal for any decentralised system, should be to make the initial founders irrelevant
and that is why we consider ourselves the “launch” team. The future team will be the token
holders. They will be the agents of the future of this network and their token holdings will
represent their power in the system.

The path to this “Exit to Community,” moment is outlined elsewhere in the whitepaper. It is
a multi-phase process that will require the establishment of norms and practices for working
with both novel decentralised tools and new methodologies for decentralised governance.
The team takes on the responsibility for not only building the technology, but also leading
and educating the community to run the system sustainably for themselves.

The team will scale to a massively distributed group of decentralised individuals, that will
coordinate on a shared vision that begins with the narrative in the whitepaper, but will end
with an indeterminate goal.

## .vote consensus mechanism

It utilises a pyramidic stacking mechanism to normalise vote power across a voting population, ensuring that large token holders do not have an extremely out weighted voice in the system

## Path to decentralization

### **Obelisk (From network genesis)**

This is the launch phase of the network during which a number of key components of the
system are introduced to the users, including auction.vote and the vote markets

In this phase a number of management keys exist that can, through human input, modify
the rules of the game in such a way that they can be optimised for adoption based on
feedback from the community

Throughout this phase, we create and optimise adversarial cryptoeconomic games that will
stress test the permissionless governance structures of the network.
These include our voting technology, which utilises quadratic voting and therefore requires
a sybil protection layer created by our identity system

Throughout this phase the voting and auction systems will be optimised using our
management keys so that we arrive at tunable parameters that can be transitioned to the
main DAO, the DMF in phase 2. The launch team will aim to utilise a transformational
leadership style, with a view towards showcasing effective practices for network
maintenance and responding dynamically to token holder feedback. Our network culture is
one of radical openness16.

### **Pyramid (Begins 6 months post genesis, end Q2 2021)**

In this phase we launch our second layer governance system, which aims to further
empower the community with decision making capability on the network.

In this phase, control of key system parameters are transitioned to the DMF and at an
appropriate time the vote market management keys will be burned.

In this phase we use quadratic voting to turn dialogue into numbers.

In this phase, the finance.vote network core team are still in service to
the users and will design, develop and deploy core technologies for the network and will
expand the community of developers and users through the use of the DMF treasury.

Throughout the pyramid phase, the finance.vote reputation system will be tuned to ensure
that a healthy mix of stake weighted and meritocratic consensus formation is used for key
decision making.

### **Starship (Target 18 months post genesis)**

In this phase, full responsibility for the network will be transferred to token holders.
All three initiating components; the vote markets, second layer governance and social
trading will be deployed to mainnet and operating effectively. Each of these will have
tunable parameters, with a history of effective decentralised decision making, with a clear
trend towards systematic optimisation.

In this phase the crowd will be in full control and all management keys will be burned.
Responsibility for future development is now with the community and network leaders will
be elected through decentralised direct democracy.
