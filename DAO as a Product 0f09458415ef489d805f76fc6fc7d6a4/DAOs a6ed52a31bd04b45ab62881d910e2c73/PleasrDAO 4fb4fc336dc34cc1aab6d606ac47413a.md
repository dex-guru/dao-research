### Governace

PleasrDAO distributes the ownership of the DAO in the form of tokens. That gives every member a fraction of its assets—the two NFTs and any funds in the treasury. Each member participates in the DAO’s governance through a group chat.

And if someone were to exit the DAO, their token would be up for grabs internally. 

Jamis Johnson,- the chief pleasing officer of PleasrDAO (CEO). He coordinates and manages the strategy of PleasrDAO
