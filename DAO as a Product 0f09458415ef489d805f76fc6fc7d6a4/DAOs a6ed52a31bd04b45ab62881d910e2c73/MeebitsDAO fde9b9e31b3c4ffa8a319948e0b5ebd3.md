# MeebitsDAO

**MeebitsDAO was born out of a single ambition: to create a vehicle for funding innovative projects that will develop the ecosystem around Meebits.**

### DAO organization:

## Previous **organization:**

- **Bootstrap Team** — The steering group currently spending time and resources on the infrastructure, engineering and administrative setup of the DAO
- **Core Team** — The early team working on behalf of the DAO
- **Community Leaders** — Members who are playing a hands-on role in building an developing the MeebitsDAO community across various channels and platforms, and acting as evangelists to connect us to other communities
- **Advisory Board** — People who are actively helping us in our decision making, lending their experience and extending to us their networks to help make the MeebitsDAO as success

## **Future organization (after full token distribution)**

- **Voting Members** — Members who hold a *‘voting seat’* and will have the ability to vote directly on proposals and decisions related to the administration of the DAO and its funds. Initially the Founding Members, but voting rights will be tokenized (ERC-721) and transferrable. These members will vote on proposals, project plans, changes to the roadmap, awarding hackathon winners, etc. (Number of members 47)
- **General Members** — Non-voting members who will still hold a stake in the DAO via *member token* and will be able to shape the direction of the DAO via their support of the Voting Members to whom they delegate their tokens (10 Tokens) (Number of members 123)
- **Sponsors** — Individuals and organizations who will be able to suggest proposals and fund bounties for the DAO to complete
