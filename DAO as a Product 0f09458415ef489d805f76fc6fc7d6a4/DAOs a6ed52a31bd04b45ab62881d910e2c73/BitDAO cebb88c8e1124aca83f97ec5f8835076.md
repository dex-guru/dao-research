# BitDAO

Allocate the world's largest DAO-directed treasury, partner with leading protocols, and build the future of finance.

### Token holders

- There was a private token sale. Public token sale is not on the plans

### Governor

- Gnosis Safe / Snapshot

### Governance

BIT token (instance of COMP). The platform uses Snapshot to vote on

- token swaps with existing and emerging projects.
- treasury allocation into various projects or autonomous entities (in the form of funding, liquidity support, and grants)
- updates to BitDAO core protocols (including governance and treasury management functions).

A major BIT token holder (Bybit) aims to delegate voting power to various Labs, Ventures, and Growth Teams.

### Working Groups

Autonomous organizations:

- Gaming
- ZK Ecosystem
- Art guilds
- Farming and liquidity cooperatives
- R&D
- Events
- Education
- Social spaces

Autonomous Entities will allow BitDAO to quickly execute on ideas and leverage the most qualified teams and decision makers without bottlenecking the BitDAO governance process (hence "autonomous" from BitDAO)
