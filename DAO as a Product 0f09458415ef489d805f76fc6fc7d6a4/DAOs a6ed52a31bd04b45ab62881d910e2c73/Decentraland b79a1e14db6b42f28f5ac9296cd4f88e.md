- Aragon

### Governance

The community will propose and vote on policy updates, future LAND auctions, whitelisting of NFT contracts to be allowed inside the World, Builder and Marketplace, and whatever the community deems relevant. Voting takes place on the Decentraland DAO's governance interface, powered by Aragon.

The DAO is supported by the Security Advisory Board (SAB). The SAB acts as the guarantor of contract security, tasked with the job of providing a swift response to bug reports.  Comprising 5 members, the Board will be made up of several expert entities or individuals initially chosen by the Decentraland team and later appointed by the community.

Members can be changed by the Aragon DAO â€“ a vote must be started to remove or install a new member. This is an action that will involve the community using wMANA. A member of the SAB creates a vote for the community to add or remove a member of the SAB and community members use wMANA to cast their vote.

Initially, until fraud risk is reduced to its minimum extent possible, votes will only be created and scheduled by the Security Advisory Board (SAB).
