# New Order

New Order was created with a goal to build a self-governing incubator positioned to assist DeFi innovation, through promoting new asset classes, chain independence and machine learning.

## Governance Process

### **Step 1: Ideation**

The forum post is created in the appropriate forum category, resulting in community feedback/discussions

No formal requirement exists for a proposal to pass from Step 1 to Step 2, though if during Step 1 the proposal does not get traction in the form of strong community discussions, it is unlikely that the proposal will be successful.

### **Step 2: Specification**

New Order Improvement Proposal is generated

Duration 5 Days

In order for a proposal to move from Step 2 to Step 3, the post should receive a majority forum poll voting. If the relative majority of votes on the forum poll indicates the result of Make no changes aka rejecting the proposal, the proposal will not pass to Phase 3.

### **Step 3: Consensus**

The New Order Improvement proposal is edited for accuracy and a New Order Snapshot poll is created

Duration 7 Days

In order for the proposals to be accepted in the 3rd Step, the Snapshot voting should have a relative majority of tokens used signaling the outcome. This outcome should be accompanied by a yes-voting quorum of a minimum of 4% of the circulating supply of New Order governance tokens. If the relative majority of tokens used in signaling on the Snapshot poll indicates the result Make no changes aka rejecting the proposal, the proposal will not be accepted and considered closed.

## SubDAO

Each Department/branch within New Order would house a DAO multisig signer. These signers would be community assigned as leaders for the departments based on the reputation they have developed through their contributions and participation in the departments of interest. 

This allows the community to decide the multisig holders, and the parameters for the decision are aligned with their importance in the DAO governance ecosystem. 

- As an example
    
    a Portfolio Manager Robert has had an outstanding track record in finding the most profitable and efficient yield strategy for the assets in the treasury, allowing the DAO to grow above industry standards. 
    
    He was further heavily contributing in proposal generation and gained the respect of the community for his thoughtful discussions and recommendation. He can run in the election for the lead position in the New Order DAO Portfolio Management department. 
    

The approach allows for expert community members to hold the multisig keys, instead of centralizing control in the core team. At genesis, a 6/9 multisig would be present that is hosted by Gnosis SafeSnap. As mentioned, each elected department leader will be carefully allocated a salary and a budget by the payroll department. 

### Idea discussion process

- When a proposal idea arises, for example a strong opinion about the direction of the treasury yield investing, the community member has a direct department to communicate with.
- The member will contact the department of Portfolio Management instead of contacting the general Q/A chat or DAO forum. With this approach proposal generation and community engagement is more organized and efficient, streamlining decision making.
- Further, to promote our approach to being chain agnostic, we will be ensuring equal voting weighting to, for example, BSC and Avalanche L1’s even though the Polygon and Ethereum communities trump them in size and development.

This approach will foster faster development in those communities allowing members to equally participate across the chains without the threat of being segregated. 

The approach is mandatory for our aspirations of a financial ecosystem, as we require full time employees to maintain the structural and organization well being of governance. 

**The current community compensation mechanisms are not able to support our goal of becoming the largest treasury of assets in DeFi and to incubate dominating protocols.** 

**Industry leading professionals would not be interested in operating part time, completing tasks on an as-needed basis.** 

Rather employing department leaders and retaining experts long term through a just compensation method will allow us to align their goals with the DAO’s creating much needed synergies.

The allocated funds will allow the department leaders to further efficiently grow the DAO.

Sub DAOs:

- Financials / Accounting
- Developer
- Marketing
- R&D / Grants
- Partnerships / Business Development
- Portfolio Management
- Venture Strategist
- Operations
- Yield Farming
- Decision Support

## **Computer Aided Governance**
