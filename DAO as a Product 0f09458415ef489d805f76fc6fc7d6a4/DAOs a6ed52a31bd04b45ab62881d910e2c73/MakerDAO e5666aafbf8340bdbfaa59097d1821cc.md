# MakerDAO

# Governance

MKR holders are responsible for governing the Maker Protocol, which includes adjusting policy for the Dai stablecoin, choosing new collateral types, and improving governance itself. Anyone can be an MKR holder and all are welcome to come join us in shaping the future of DeFi.

# Core Unit Target Operating Model

Proposed as next step towards community decentralization. The transition implies phased-based approach.

### The Core Unit

It contains a Mandate, akin to a *question* that the Facilitator must answer with the available resources.

### Mandate

Core Unit Mandates set the direction of the work that Facilitators must help carry out by using their budget and exercising their Governance Powers.

**Core Objectives and Domains**

Core Objectives and Domains are not directly defined in the DAO Primitives MIP Set but are flexible concepts that emerge through the interaction of DAO Primitives.

### The Budget

Budgets are used to fund the work defined by the Core Units chosen by Maker Governance. A budget is attached to a Core Unit and is meant to be used only for that Core Unit. The Core Unit Facilitators must ensure that transparency and accountability exist as the budget is spent.

### The Facilitator

The most trusted actor in the Community; interacts with Governance and the Contributors to organize activities to achieve the Objectives. It contains the name and information and the commitment (the how).

Facilitators play a key role in the Maker ecosystem by acting as the link between Maker Governance and the Contributors. Facilitators are always attached to a Core Unit that defines their primary responsibility and their Budget and Governance Powers.

The Core Unit Budget allows the facilitators to meet their responsibilities by hiring Contributors and purchasing services and products. Facilitators attached to a Core Unit administer the Budget for that Core Unit. How this is implemented in practice depends on the specific Budget Implementation.

### Contributors

The groups of people performing the tasks to maintain and grow the protocol can focus on their job while the Facilitator acts as a proxy and deals with the bureaucracy of interacting with Maker Governance.

## Trust, rather than control

Governance is not looking to micromanage any given group. Arguably most MKR holders prefer a relatively hands-off approach and to be consulted in critical decisions (potentially contentious).The Framework provides Core Unit Facilitators with enough flexibility and margin to quickly react to new events. In return, they’re expected to provide clarity into their actions and expenditures.While Governance has methods to remove a Core Unit Facilitator (non-performing, rogue, etc.), these agents need to receive the corresponding remuneration and enough trust and autonomy upfront to perform well.
