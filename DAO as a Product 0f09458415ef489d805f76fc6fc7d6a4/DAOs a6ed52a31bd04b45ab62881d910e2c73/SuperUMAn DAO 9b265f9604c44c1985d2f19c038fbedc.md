## [Joining DAO & Member tier process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CIP42HMVuFoPQE27q47ywy5ImF-PoUrXWn2Dc0JY3uA/edit#)

Once a potential member expresses interest, they are directed to fill in an application to alert the onboarding team, who will complete the initial onboarding process with them, this would include.

- A commitment to the mission, goals and values of the DAO
- Completion of a short introductory course to the SuperUMAn DAO
- Team selection
- Completion of a short task(s) as assigned by the chosen team lead.

On completion of the above, an ENS subdomain NFT will be minted for the wallet address that they provide to indicate their recruit status.

The promotions process through a soft consensus based around a Discord poll followed by a confirmatory governance vote will take place every six weeks, if successful, the recruit NFT will be burnt and a new SuperUMAn NFT will be minted and issued.

The following processes are in place:

- Exiting the DAO
    - If there is substantial misalignment between the member and the mission, values and goals of the DAO, an active off-boarding process, managed by the Community Management team within the Operations Team, with initial infractions dealt with on an informal basis, prior to a formal process being invoked, involving limiting communications actions,
        
        The forcible removal off a member from the DAO will be a matter of governance and will involve sending that member’s NFT to a burn address.
        
- Redesignation of Role
    - A SuperUMAn may be reduced a tier, with a demotion to ex-member may be in order following a review panel comprised of 9 UMAsters, chosen at the time. If the panel confirms that the SuperUMAn should be demoted their decision will be confirmed through governance where upon their SuperUMAn NFT will be burnt and an Ex-member NFT issued.
- Reactiviating SuperUMAn Status
    - Discord poll

## Governance

Tier membership will confer differential voting rights through a multiplier effect. The proposed tiers are:

- Recruits + Honorary DAOplomats + inactive ex-SuperUMAns - baseline: one member, one vote
- SuperUMAns - enhanced: one member, 10 votes
- UMAsters - enhanced plus: one member 20 votes.

### SuperUMAn DAO

The SuperUMAn DAO is organised into functions with 9 teams as documented below together with their areas of responsibility.

- **Education Team**
- **Operations team**
- **Social Media Team**
- **Onboarding Team**
- **Ambassador Team**
- **Content Team**
- **Treasury Team**
- **Governance Team**
- **Research and Products Team**

## Compensation

Compensation rates are based on levels (1-3 scale) and performance (1-4) scale

[Basically 3 approaches are discussed:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k-0QyOzrg5C9xsEQic4bahUIl1UXfJ1YzC7hAEwaSzA/edit)

1. sSlary + bonus structure
2. Payouts with KPI options being a main form of payout and a smaller baseline but higher potential payout
3. The basic premise is that there are two pools of funds: 1) a Budget pool that pays the expected costs and 2) a profit pool that allocates expected revenues in excess of costs (net profit) at some period in the future.

Coordinape can also be combined here quarterly or monthly.
