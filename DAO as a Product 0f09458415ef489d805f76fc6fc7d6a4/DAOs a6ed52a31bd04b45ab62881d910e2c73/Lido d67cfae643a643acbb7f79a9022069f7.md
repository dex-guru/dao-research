### Governance

DAO members manage protocol parameters, lists of node operators and oracle members, and can vote on app upgrades.

DAO members voting power is proportional to the share of Lido DAO tokens they hold. Voting parameters (voting duration, minimal quorum and minimal approval) are specified at the start of the DAO; DAO members specify those parameters during the protocol setup.

Any DAO member can make a proposal for the DAO to vote on.

The proposal succeeds if it has 1) at least the minimal quorum of the total votes cast, and 2) at least the minimal acceptance rate of the cast votes supporting the proposal. If a proposal gains the support by at least the approval threshold of the total DAO voting power, such proposal succeeds immediately
