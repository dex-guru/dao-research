# Rarible

Open Source, Cross-Chain Community Governed NFT Protocol. It was developed by [Rarible.com](http://Rarible.com) and later inherited by Rarible DAO. It is a protocol governed by the $RARI token. There is no legal entity to our DAO.

It is a protocol governed by the $RARI token.

### Working Groups

The DAO itself is structured into [Working Groups](https://www.notion.so/Our-Working-Groups-f04d7fd959354ee9a884cd59e5d2d17f). Below is a rough idea of what these working groups are, and the people involved. 

DAO is moving towards a model where each working group has their own funds, and governance process, independent of the parent Rarible DAO. 

The flow of funds would move from the parent Rarible DAO, to the working groups, and those working groups would be responsible for hiring, reporting, accountability internal to their group.

### DAO Governance

In order to remain an attractive place for people to want to work and add value, we will move towards some form of representative democracy. Practically, this means that people with subject matter expertise, groups with vested interest (investors, applications, etc) as well as workers have governance and decision making power. 

As a DAO, we will take an experimental and iterative approach to governance, and learning through experimentation at the Working Group level.
