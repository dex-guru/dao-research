# SushiSwapDAO

# Governance & Org Structure Transition

Sushi has operated with a flat organizational structure driven by specific cults of personalities. However, DAOs and digital asset protocols are still very nascent and require structure to continue to grow.

Over the past year, Sushi has seen tremendous success in community-driven DAO and protocol efforts, but as the protocol scales, it needs proper structural hierarchy, resourcing, processes, and principles for the various teams that are building under the Sushi DAO.

1. Establish a new service collective through a community vote and transition the existing ops multisig to the discretion of the new collective. The hierarchical structure of this new collective will be tasked with continued protocol development, expansion, and business development.
2. Treasury multisig will remain subject to governance. 
3. The collective structure will follow a product teams format that will fully resource each SUSHI product line and allow it to scale.
4. A new hierarchical structure that will clearly delineate roles and responsibilities for the following lead individuals. These individuals will work together to oversee the transition to the outlined structure and oversee the development of the vision established through governance.
5. Establish further checks and balances and community oversight over Sushi’s roadmap leadership, and transparency.
6. Establish a clearer mandate of what decisions have to go through a governance vote, versus what decisions are left to the service collective.

The goal is to give the service collective as much autonomy and flexibility as possible to effectively develop community-owned defi products while ensuring that all Sushi stakeholders continue to be the checks and balances system via governance.

Goals:

The goal of this new recommended collective structure is to:

1. Align the service collective through clear governance oversight
2. Add scalability through the creation of product teams within this service collective
3. Create clear leadership and hierarchy within the service collective to allocate resources, dictate growth strategy and business decisions, and the power to on and off-board contributors

**New Collective Structure**

The structure of the new collective will:

1. Create product teams working on specific product lines under a well defined hierarchical structure as outlined below and
2. The breakdown of contributors through the creation of an [OSC (Open-Source Contributor) levels model 54](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-dao-restructure-proposal/6282). It will also allow for this service collective to utilize its own entities where needed rather than contributors paying for integrations and other expenses out of pocket. If new entities are necessary, the new service collective will work with legal counsel to establish an entity based on best practices.

Every product team would consist of one or multiple contributors focused on product, designers, front-end, solidity, web3, marketing, & business development. 

We recommend the creation of product-specific teams, composed of contributors that work within these teams but that also report to both VPs and subsequently Heads of three major groups. The groups and general responsibilities are as follows:

Head of Strategy

The Head of Strategy will have oversight of growth marketing strategy, design, roadmap, and go-to-market strategy. They will also work with leadership and governance (in accordance to the governance oversight section below) on executing partnerships

Head of Operations and Business Development

The Head of Operations and Business Development will oversee the product managers, business development, and infrastructure to allocate resources according to the roadmap and governance-approved grants. 

Head of Engineering

The Head of Engineering will oversee the development of Sushi products and the roadmap. 

VP (Vice Heads):

Strategy, Operations, Engineering will have vice heads to execute and retain discretion over specific products and teams. They will be selected and promoted from teams at the discretion of the initial collective Heads to work with and extend specific responsibilities.

Marketing

Marketing should include product marketing, content marketing, digital marketing, and work with other product teams to have consistent brand and marketing efforts across all business lines. The marketing team will cross-coordinate with other products.

Product

Full understanding of the scope of the product from initial wireframes to building out the product to designing go-to-market strategies, as well as overseeing business development and marketing efforts. 

Designers

UX and UI designers are responsible for building the frontend interfaces, iterating user personas, and designing user tests. Other areas include supporting marketing with marketing assets.

Frontend

FE devs should be responsible for implementing mockups as well as a deep understanding of web3 and developing apps that interact with smart contracts.

Solidity

Solidity devs are in control of the core functionalities of the product and ensure infrastructural compatibility with the rest of the product.

Business development

BD focuses on bringing the product to retail and institutions, as well as onboarding inbound leads.

Human Resources

Human Resources will manage relationships within the team(s), along with onboarding/offboarding procedures and salary/bonus structure.

Finance/Accounting

Finance/Accounting will manage funds and process payments within the new entity. They will be responsible for monthly invoices as well as other expenses.

### **Leadership**

The leadership team will work together to develop and execute a roadmap.

They have discretionary powers to allocate resources to the different product teams based on the roadmap and opportunity set. 

They also have the power to onboard contributors as well as set KPI’s for each contributor to hit. All decisions will go through a vote between the Head of Strategy, Head of Engineering, and Head of Operations and Business Development. 

This will ensure that all aspects of Sushi and its products are represented in the decision-making process as well as prevent one team lead from taking too much power. 

### **Service collective multisig**

The service collective will inherit the operational multisig, however, will not have discretion on any protocol-level changes with regards, some examples pertaining to:

- Modifications to xSUSHI
- Modifications to tokenomics (vesting)

The operational multisig will retain the right to assign members where appropriate to balance efficiency as well as security.

The operational multisig and treasury multisig will remain separate and with separate individuals. No individual should not sit on both.

The operational multisig is recommended to comprise of no less than 5 individuals. They are bounded by the same traditions of governance with regard to protocol modifications.

### G**overnance**

1. Governance will continue to oversee the allocation of all Treasury assets. This includes overseeing all grants to the service collective as well as grants from the upcoming Sushi Rolls platform. This will include any DAO-level partnerships. Examples of this include the creation of Shoyu as well as the recent Tokenmak and Flipside CEA proposal.
2. In accordance with this proposal, governance will now have discretionary power over the service collective. This includes annual reviews of the quarterly reporting to be provided by the service collective.
3. Governance will also continue to have oversight on protocol modifications and tokenomics, including any changes made to xSUSHI.
4. Governance will have the ability to issue a mandate via governance to the service collective. This restructuring proposal as well as a future Code of Conduct proposal will fall under this category.

### **Transition Period**

The transition period will last 3-6 weeks starting in Q1 and be overseen by the proposed project leads. They will be responsible in overseeing the following recommendations:

- Creation of Product Teams, with a service collective level hierarchy for onboarding new contributors:
    - Allocation of contributors to each product team
    - Oversee onboarding and offboarding during this transition period
- Oversee first proposed Q2 budget/grant request for governance, after 2 month grace period
- Creation of the 2022 roadmap
- Any other items that need to be addressed during the re-structure

**Additional Checks and Balances**

To structure in accountability we propose the following additional checks and balances:

1. Aggregate leadership (Heads and Vice Heads) of the service collective will be reviewed annually by governance. Additionally, a vote to renew the service collective will occur annually with the first votes for both taking place in June 2022.
2. Leadership from the service collective will develop a quarterly grant approved via governance proposal and approved by the community, to then allocate resources effectively to each product line. If additional funding is needed during a quarter, leadership can submit an additional proposal for governance approval. Salaries, compensation should also be part of annual budgeting and proposals. It is up to the discretion of leadership to handle the dispensation of salaries and bonuses within the service collective.
3. Leadership from the service collective will develop Quarterly and Yearly updates for the community similar to tradfi 10Q/K’s.
4. Leadership from the service collective will participate in Monthly AMA’s to update and hear from the Sushi community.
