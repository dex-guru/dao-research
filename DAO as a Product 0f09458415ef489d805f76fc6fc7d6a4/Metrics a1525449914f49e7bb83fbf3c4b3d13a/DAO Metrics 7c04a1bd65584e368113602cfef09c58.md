## Community Health

- **Member conversion funnel**
    
    The member conversion funnel tracks the change in the number of members who have joined and left the DAO over a certain period of time, including multiple membership tiers, promotions/advancements.
    
- **Small world score**
    
    A normalized score (between 0 and 100) which measures the fit between the overall shape of the DAOs collaboration network and a [small world network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network) - a network where the typical distance (the number of steps required) between two randomly chosen members grows proportionally to the logarithm of the number of members in the network
    
- **Top-5 connectors & outliers**
    
    A list of the top-5 members with the highest [betweenness centrality](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/betweenness-centrality/) score and a list of the top-5 members with the lowest [closeness centrality](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/closeness-centrality/) score.
    
- **Number of people each member onboards/brings into DAO**
    
    Measure of decentralized growth and proxy for retention and construction (both prerequisites of members bringing others in)
    
- **Contributor/Member ratio**
- **Discord / other social General Metrics**
    - Number of new member joining
    - Number of leaves over time
    - Number of activations of 1st day
    - Retention
    - Visitors = a user who has clicked into the server and viewed a channel
    - Communicators = a visitor who talked (voice or text)
    - Total Messages sent
    - Total Voice minutes
    - Message activity
    - Voice activity
- **Community Engagement**
- **MAC - Monthly Active Contributors**
- **Time-To-Contribution**
    
    TTC is defined as the amount of time it takes for someone to make their first contribution to the DAO from the moment they join
    

## Governance Health

- **Proposal approval rate**
    
    The % of governance proposals in a given period of time that get approved.
    
- **Voting participation rate**
    
    The % of community members who have participated in a particular governance decision
    
- **Rolling voting participation rate**
    
    The % of community members who have participated in governance decisions **over a certain period of time**.
    
- **Number of accounts participating in discussion leading up to a vote in % of token holding accounts.**
- **Proposals per contributor**
- **% of proposals that have a yes-no margin of 20% or less**

## Finance Health

- **Top 10 outflows**
    
    T**racking the Top-10 spend categories of the DAO token from the DAO treasury evolve over time.**
    
- **Plan vs. actual spend**
    
    A month-by-month (or week-by-week) tracking on the amount of community token the DAO intended to spend, according to its seasonal plan, compared to the amount that was actually spent.
    
- **Community token Gini index**
    
    The [Gini Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) is a measure of wealth inequality in a social group. It varies between 0 (when everyone is holding the exact same amount of wealth) and 1 (when a single person is holding all the wealth) and therefore offers a quantitative measure of inequality in the group.
    
- T**reasury Value**
- T**op treasury tokens**
- G**overnance token holders**
- Churn Rate
- Revenue growth rate
- Gross profit margin
- Net profit margin
- Earnings Per Token
- Total profit Added on a monthly basis
- Monthly Budget divergence for Working Groups
