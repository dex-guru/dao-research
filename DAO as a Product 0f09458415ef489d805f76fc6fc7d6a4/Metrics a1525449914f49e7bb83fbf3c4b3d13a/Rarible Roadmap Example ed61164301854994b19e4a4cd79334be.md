# Rarible Roadmap Example

### DAO Roadmap

*DAO Architecture*

Over the next couple months, the plan is to reorganize working groups such that we can operate more effectively. This is a work in progress. 

*DAO Governance.* 

Currently, governance is done via Snapshot + Multisig execution. There are a number of problems with this, and a few proposed solutions (moving towards some sort of representative democracy for example, or moving to a more interim solution such as allocating RARI tokens to the DAO contributors). 

The hope is to take iterative steps towards our governance over the next several months, while also learning from the work happening within Working Groups. 

*Rarible Protocol.* 

There are a number of components of our protocol that are centralized. There have been a number of discussions around decentralizing these elements, but this is a long term play. Things that need to be decentralized, include: 

- The currently centralized orderbook
- The indexer
- The smart contract upgradability functions.

The timeline for the decentralization of all of this is likely >2 years.
