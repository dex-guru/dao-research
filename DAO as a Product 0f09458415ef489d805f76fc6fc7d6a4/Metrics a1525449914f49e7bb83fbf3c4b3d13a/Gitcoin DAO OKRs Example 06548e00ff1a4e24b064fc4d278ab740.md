# Gitcoin DAO OKRs Example

## Proposed OKRs for H1 2022:

### Objective 1: More Scale:

- Increase the number of Grants that raise >$5k/quarter by 50%
- Increase the number of high quality hackathon submissions by 50%

### Objective 2: More Decentralization:

- 2 implementations of ($1k GMV each) dGrants forks (horizontal scale)
- Ensure each instance of Grants has a shared registry of grants so that we can migrate a grant from cGrants to dGrants once, for all Grants.
- Release a generally available MVP of a shared registry of Sybil information and collect feedback
- Evaluation, roadmap planning for how might we merge Grants in H2 2022
- Evaluation, roadmap planning for how might we evolve our Hack/Bounties platform

## Discussion Draft

*Scale: Grow grants program*

- GMV (normalized for market conditions?)
- # of grants receiving a certain amount of funding (>$5K?)

*Scalability: Set ourselves up to execute grants on a larger scale*

- # of processes/systems put in place (e.g., run books, CRM, dedicated roles, etc.) - though we don‚Äôt want to over-process / red-tape things, curious as to what could be a good metric
- Actual use of those processes/systems (sth around time saved? Less things we screw up? Fewer balls dropped, less wasted time)

*Decentralization: Continue to decentralize grants program*

- % of GMV on dGrants / dGrants registry (to be informed by higher-level 2022 OKRs)
- Increase utility of GTC in the context of grants (e.g., staking)
- Move grants ops completely out of Gitcoin Holdings & into DAO
- Increase role of stewards/governance in grants decision-making (e.g., round structure, providing input on success of rounds & what to do next time, etc.)
